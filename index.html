       <p style="color:beige; margin:10px ">Srividhya Chandramouleeswaran began learning bharatanatyam at the age of 6 under the guidance of Smt Janani Narayanan, artistic director of Nrityakalya Dabfr Company, in the Bay Area, California. As a part of Nrityakalya Dance Comoany, she has been a part of their major dance productions, and participated in numerous dance competitions both with her group and solo. After completing her arangetram in 2019 at the age of 13, she participated in the workshops conducted by Lakshman Sir throughout 2020 and 2021. In 2023, she began learning under Acharya Choodamani Guru A Lakshmanaswamy through online classes. It is under his tutelage that this recital has come to life. For the past 1.5 years, Srividhya has had the privelege of learning under Lakshman Sir and is deeply grateful for his patience and guidance. 
        Srividhya is 18 years old and will be attending New York University in the Fall in the Tandon school of Engineering, pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Integrated Design and Media. Beyond dance, Srividhya pursues multiple forms of art, learning Carnatic vocal under Smt Hamsa Raghuvir, disciple of Sri. Lalgudi G Jayaraman, and continues to make mixed media artwork in her free time. The works displayed in the lobby were made by her. She wishes to combine art with technology and explore its different uses in the future. Srividhya earned her diploma in Bharanatyam from the University of Silicon Andhra in California in June of this year, as well. She is very grateful for this opportunity to present her solo debut in Chennai today.</p>
